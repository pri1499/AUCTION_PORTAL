# AUCTION_PORTAL
To meet with the pace of the competitive world, e-Procurement (electronic procurement) has developed as a progressive instrument in modern industrial sector. This project entitled e-Procurement can be considered as the computerization of transactions of closeouts in material administration division of Vishakhapatnam Steel Plant to meet the quick handling of transactions in these Hi-tech days. This project incorporates all the provisions like client raising auctions online, supplier submitting his auctions online, Client being permitted to get to concerned information just inside a settled vacancy designated for recovering or controlling database.

Proposed System computerizes all the activities right from generation of ITA(Invitation To Auction) to generation Acceptance to Auction (i.e. Purchase Order). The website is designed, developed, deployed and maintained to serve this purpose. This system is a web-based application developed on three-tier architecture.
•	Purchase department sends Enquiries / ITAs to various registered Suppliers by using this system. 
•	Suppliers, who receives ITA, can directly log in to system from anywhere in the world and participate in reverse auction. 
•	Purchase Department Users has log in to the system and generates Purchase Order / Acceptance to Auction to the successful bidder of the reverse auction. 

This system implements two levels of application level security in addition to database level security.
1.Database user-id and password is being maintained only the Project Manager, who is authorized by the top-level management. No other person can connect to the database directly. All the users of the system connect to the database through application only.

2.This security is categorized by login security. And by this all secured data is in safely placed. All the valid users are given access to use this system. In this level, System checks whether the user is authorized user or not.

Advantages of Proposed System:
•	Since this process of raising ITA, Generating of Purchase order is done through online, the total time will be drastically reduced. 

•	Manual preparation of ITAs, which is a highly tedious and time taking process, is avoided. 

•	Tracking of any ITA is very easy. 

•	High level of data and application security is possible due to first level database security, two levels of application security.
